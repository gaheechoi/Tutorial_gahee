<br>

<dt>name = cdata [CS]</dt>
<dd>This attribute names the current anchor so that it may be the destination of another link. The value of this attribute must be a unique anchor name. The scope of this name is the current document. Note that this attribute shares the same name space as the id attribute.</dd>
<br>
<dt>href = uri [CT]</dt>
<dd>This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus defining a link between the current element (the source anchor) and the destination anchor defined by this attribute.</dd>
<br>
<dt>hreflang = langcode [CI]</dt>
<dd>This attribute specifies the base language of the resource designated by href and may only be used when href is specified.</dd>

<dt>type = content-type [CI]</dt>
<dd>This attribute gives an advisory hint as to the content type of the content available at the link target address. It allows user agents to opt to use a fallback mechanism rather than fetch the content if they are advised that they will get content in a content type they do not support.
Authors who use this attribute take responsibility to manage the risk that it may become inconsistent with the content available at the link target address.
For the current list of registered content types, please consult [MIMETYPES].</dd>
<dt>rel = link-types [CI]</dt>
<dd>This attribute describes the relationship from the current document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.</dd>
<dt>rev = link-types [CI]</dt>
<dd>This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the anchor specified by the href attribute to the current document. The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.</dd>
<dt>charset = charset [CI]</dt>
<dd>This attribute specifies the character encoding of the resource designated by the link. Please consult the section on character encodings for more details.

<h1>2.1 Syntax of anchor names</h1>

<p align="center">An anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when used in the context of anchors. Anchor names must observe the following rules:

Uniqueness: Anchor names must be unique within a document. Anchor names that differ only in case may not appear in the same document.
String matching: Comparisons between fragment identifiers and anchor names must be done by exact (case-sensitive) match.
Thus, the following example is correct with respect to string matching and must be considered a match by user agents:


Anchor names should be restricted to ASCII characters. Please consult the appendix for more information about non-ASCII characters in URI attribute values.</p>


<strong>2.2 Nested links are illegal</strong>

<p>Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A element must not contain any other A elements.

Since the DTD defines the LINK element to be empty, LINK elements may not be nested either.</p>


<strong>2.3 Anchors with the id attribute</strong>

<p>The id attribute may be used to create an anchor at the start tag of any element (including the A element).

This example illustrates the use of the id attribute to position an anchor in an H2 element. The anchor is linked to via the A element.

You may read more about this in
Because of its specification in the HTML DTD, the name attribute may contain character references. Thus, the value D&#xfc;rst is a valid name attribute value, as is D&uuml;rst . The id attribute, on the other hand, may not contain character references.

Use id or name? Authors should consider the following issues when deciding whether to use id or name for an anchor name:

The id attribute can act as more than just an anchor name (e.g., style sheet selector, processing identifier, etc.).
Some older user agents don't support anchors created with the id attribute.
The name attribute allows richer anchor names (with entities).</p>


<strong>2.4 Unavailable and unidentifiable resources</strong>

<p>A reference to an unavailable or unidentifiable resource is an error. Although user agents may vary in how they handle such an error, we recommend the following behavior:

If a user agent cannot locate a linked resource, it should alert the user.
If a user agent cannot identify the type of a linked resource, it should still attempt to process it. It should alert the user and may allow the user to intervene and identify the document type.
The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly one link.
Authors may also create an A element that specifies no anchors, i.e., that doesn't specify href, name, or id. Values for these attributes may be set at a later time through scripts.

In the example that follows, the A element defines a link. The source anchor is the text "W3C Web site" and the destination anchor is "http://www.w3.org/":

For more information about W3C, please consult the The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly one link.
Authors may also create an A element

<div class="footer1">
    <p>HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text and structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup languages is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This section introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the primary forces driving the success of the Web.
A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor, which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document, etc.). </p>
